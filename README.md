# Baby Monitoring System
Final project for University of Washington CSE474 Embedded Systems course.  
  
Designed for two Arduino Nano ESP32 Boards. There is code to be uploaded on the "baby board" and the "parent board". The baby board reads values from sensors in the baby's room and sends them to the parent side. Plays a song to the baby if instructed by the parent side. The parent board allows viewing values or sensors sent from the baby side, triggering an alarm if a value is in a bad range, and sending a song to the baby.
